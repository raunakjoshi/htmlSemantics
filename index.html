      Football, also known as soccer in some parts of the world, is a globally
      cherished sport that unites people across cultures and continents. With a
      rich history dating back centuries, football has evolved into a spectacle
      that captivates millions of fans. Played on rectangular fields, the
      objective of the game is simple yet exhilarating: two teams of eleven
      players each compete to score goals by propelling a ball into the opposing
      team's net. The sport demands a harmonious blend of skill, strategy, and
      teamwork, showcasing the athletic prowess of its participants.
